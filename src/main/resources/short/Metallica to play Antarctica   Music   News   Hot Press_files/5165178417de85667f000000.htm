A simple blood test may change the face of prenatal care</h2><p class="desc"></p><p><a href="http://scopeblog.stanford.edu/files/2013/10/SM-egg2.jpg"></a>I love my kids. Really, I do. But I’m afraid that I may come across as a bit of a curmudgeon to my friends, family and even my regular readers when I write about the day-to-day life as a parent of three busy kids. Take this excerpt from my most recent <a href="http://stanmed.stanford.edu/2013fall/article7.html">contribution </a>to our <a href="http://stanmed.stanford.edu/2013fall/">current issue</a> of Stanford Medicine:</p><p>Most woman who have been pregnant are familiar with how the growing fetus takes over the mother’s body — slowly, at first, and then with increasing ferocity as bladder and lungs and belly are stretched and pounded. The process is quite humbling.</p><p>So when I learned that up to 10 percent of free-floating genetic material in a mother’s blood actually comes from the fetus, I rolled my eyes and snorted. First my body, and then my blood? Does the indignity never end?</p><p>Ok, maybe I *am* a bit of a sourpuss sometimes. Because it turns out that this genetic material allows us to learn some amazing things about that person-to-be. It’s now possible to deduce the entire genome of a fetus from a pregnant woman’s blood sample, for example. And although we’re nowhere near offering that service routinely (and there’s a robust conversation to be had around the use of such information in a healthy pregnancy), we can use a similar approach to screen for some common genetic anomalies with no risk to the fetus. As I describe in the article, the new, noninvasive blood test:</p><p>… can identify about 99 percent of Down syndrome cases as early as 10 weeks of pregnancy. False-positive rates reported by the companies hover at around 0.1 percent for detecting Down syndrome, and false negatives for the condition appear to be even more rare.</p><p>The article was fascinating to research and to write, and it illustrates some of the challenges of integrating new technological advances with routine prenatal care. Who should be offered the test? How shall women be counseled about the results? What diseases can we (or should we) detect? One thing is clear. Things have changed since my pregnancies. And regardless of my apparently verbal, or literary, stick-shaking, I’m truly glad that my children will have access to these advances in prenatal care when they start families of their own. You know. A long, LONG time from now.</p><p>Previously: <a title="Permanent Link to From womb to world: Stanford Medicine Magazine explores new work on having a baby" href="http://scopeblog.stanford.edu/2013/10/21/from-womb-to-world-stanford-medicine-magazine-explores-new-work-on-having-a-baby/" rel="bookmark">From womb to world: Stanford Medicine Magazine explores new work on having a baby</a>, <a href="http://scopeblog.stanford.edu/2013/04/23/whole-genome-fetal-sequencing-recognized-as-one-of-the-years-10-breakthrough-technologies/">Whole-genome fetal sequencing recognized as one of the year’s “10 Breakthrough Technologies”</a> and<a href="https://scopeblog.stanford.edu/2011/09/22/new-techniques-to-diagnose-disease-in-a-fetus/"> New techniques to diagnose disease in a fetus</a><br>Illustration by Christopher Silas Neal</p><div class="feedflare"><a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/stanford/scope?a=rPUjISjCGaU:ap_l3KHb9Kk:yIl2AUoC8zA"></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/stanford/scope?a=rPUjISjCGaU:ap_l3KHb9Kk:7Q72WNTAKBA"></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/stanford/scope?a=rPUjISjCGaU:ap_l3KHb9Kk:qj6IDK7rITs"></a></div><p></p><a href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/stanford/scope/~3/rPUjISjCGaU/" target="_blank">more Krista Conger</a><p><em>Written by Krista Conger</em><br><em>Date published: 2013-10-25T03:55:55.285Z</em></p></li><li><h2 class="title">Tweet from <a href="https://twitter.com/MensFitnessMag" target="_blank">MensFitnessMag</a> on 2013-10-25T11:40:54.234Z</h2><p class="desc">You might have heard of the military press and may even include it in your workout, but are you doing it properly? <a href="http://t.co/DKaF5bmW6S" target="_blank">http://t.co/DKaF5bmW6S</a> </p><a href="https://twitter.com/Men%E2%80%99s%20Fitness%20Mag/status/393703711668576256" target="_blank">more from Men’s Fitness Mag</a><p><em>Written by Men’s Fitness Mag</em><br><em>Date published: 2013-10-25T11:40:54.234Z</em></p></li><li><h2 class="title">Tweet from <a href="https://twitter.com/MensFitness" target="_blank">MensFitness</a> on 2013-10-25T12:10:00.970Z</h2><p class="desc">If you have to run in the morning, wouldn't you want one of these hotties as a partner? <a href="http://t.co/KkgvlyuW35" target="_blank">http://t.co/KkgvlyuW35</a> </p><a href="https://twitter.com/Men's%20Fitness/status/393711037859381248" target="_blank">more from Men's Fitness</a><p><em>Written by Men's Fitness</em><br><em>Date published: 2013-10-25T12:10:00.970Z</em></p></li><li><h2 class="title">Medical school leaders to Congress: Stop NIH budget cuts</h2><p class="desc"></p><p>In a <a href="https://www.aamc.org/download/358470/data/medicalschooldeans-teachinghospitalceosletteronnih.pdf">letter</a>&nbsp;(.pdf) to Congress yesterday, nearly 200 medical school deans and hospital CEOs expressed their “grave concern regarding the impact of the continued cuts, especially those imposed by sequestration” on NIH-supported research. The group of leaders, including Stanford’s <a href="http://med.stanford.edu/leadership/dean/">Lloyd Minor</a>, MD, went on to say:</p><p align="LEFT">Sequestration already has resulted in the loss of $1.5 billion from the NIH budget in FY 2013. This reduction comes at the end of a decade that has seen NIH lose more than 20 percent of its purchasing power after inflation. As a result, the percentage of promising research proposals that NIH is able to fund has fallen to less than 17 percent, an all-time low. Furthermore, NIH estimates it will lose a total $19 billion from its budget if sequestration is allowed to continue for the next eight years, delaying progress for patients awaiting the chance for a better</p><p align="LEFT">Enacted and proposed cuts in NIH funding threaten current and emerging basic research opportunities across the country, as well as the clinical studies that are essential to bring scientific discoveries from the bench to the bedside. Further, these cuts also will discourage young people from careers in medical research, risking the loss of the next generation of innovators and their ideas.</p><p>Previously: <a title="Permanent Link to Senate proposes to increase NIH’s budget in 2014" href="http://scopeblog.stanford.edu/2013/07/10/senate-proposes-to-increase-nihs-budget-in-2014/" rel="bookmark">Senate proposes to increase NIH’s budget in 2014</a>, <a title="Permanent Link to NIH director on scaring young scientists with budget cuts: “If they go away, they won’t come back”" href="http://scopeblog.stanford.edu/2013/05/22/nih-director-on-scaring-young-scientists-with-budget-cuts-if-they-go-away-they-wont-come-back/" rel="bookmark">NIH director on scaring young scientists with budget cuts: “If they go away, they won’t come back”</a>&nbsp;and <a title="Permanent Link to Sequestration hits the NIH – fewer new grants, smaller budgets" href="http://scopeblog.stanford.edu/2013/05/08/sequestration-hits-the-nih-fewer-new-grants-smaller-budgets/" rel="bookmark">Sequestration hits the NIH – fewer new grants, smaller budgets</a><br>Via <a href="https://www.aamc.org/newsroom/newsreleases/358476/20131022.html">Association of American Medical Colleges</a></p><div class="feedflare"><a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/stanford/scope?a=EUbx3HPgvBc:-bfe0rOBFPY:yIl2AUoC8zA"></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/stanford/scope?a=EUbx3HPgvBc:-bfe0rOBFPY:7Q72WNTAKBA"></a> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/stanford/scope?a=EUbx3HPgvBc:-bfe0rOBFPY:qj6IDK7rITs"></a></div><p></p><a href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/stanford/scope/~3/EUbx3HPgvBc/" target="_blank">more Michelle Brandt</a><p><em>Written by Michelle Brandt</em><br><em>Date published: 2013-10-25T03:55:55.292Z</em></p></li><li><h2 class="title">Tweet from <a href="https://twitter.com/WomensHealthMag" target="_blank">WomensHealthMag</a> on 2013-10-25T12:15:49.318Z</h2><p class="desc">Q: How long does it ACTUALLY take to lose baby weight?
